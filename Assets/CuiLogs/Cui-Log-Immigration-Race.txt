Trump Defends Aginst Critism of Border Cage Use, Shifts Blame to Previous Administration Amid Family Separation Criticism


fact check: 1: The Trump administration's family separation policy is not a result of Democratic laws or actions.

2: The policy of separating children from parents seeking asylum was implemented by the Trump administration, not mandated by any law. This approach has drawn widespread criticism and outrage across the political spectrum.

3: The family separation policy, enacted under President Donald Trump, was a deliberate decision by his administration as part of a "zero-tolerance" approach to illegal immigration. Contrary to President Trump's claims, there was no existing law that required such separations; instead, it was a policy choice aimed at deterring migration. Reports indicate that thousands of children were held in facilities described as cages, and many parents were deported without their children.
